If you want the highest viewed general architecture playlist go with #1 (Gaurav Sen’s).
If you want pure microservices architecture deep dive #3 or #4.
If you are working with Java/Spring Boot specifically #5.
If you like, I can dig further and find 10-15 more playlists, show full view counts, subscriber metrics, and filter by topic (e.g., Scala/Go/Cloud) so you can pick the very top ones.
