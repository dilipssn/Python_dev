Excellent idea! Here are 10 practical exercises to help you practice file reading operations:

## Exercise 1: Read and Count Lines
Create a text file with some content. Write a program that reads the file and prints the total number of lines.

## Exercise 2: Find Longest Line
Read a text file and find the longest line. Print both the line and its length.

## Exercise 3: Word Counter
Read a text file and count how many times a specific word appears (case-insensitive).

## Exercise 4: JSON Student Records
Create a JSON file with student records (name, age, grade). Read it and print only students with grade above 80.

## Exercise 5: CSV Salary Analysis
Create a CSV file with employee names and salaries. Read it and calculate:
- Average salary
- Highest paid employee
- Lowest paid employee

## Exercise 6: File Content Reverser
Read a text file line by line and print all lines in reverse order (last line first).

## Exercise 7: JSON to CSV Converter
Read data from a JSON file and write it to a CSV file. For example, convert a list of products with name and price.

## Exercise 8: CSV Filter
Read a CSV file with product data (name, category, price). Create a new CSV file containing only products from a specific category.

## Exercise 9: Multiple File Reader
Create 3-4 small text files. Write a program that reads all of them and combines their content into a single output file.

## Exercise 10: Data Validator
Create a JSON file with user data (name, email, age). Read it and check:
- If email contains '@'
- If age is between 18 and 100
- Print validation results for each user

---

**Tips for Practice:**
- Start with exercises 1-3 (basic text files)
- Move to exercises 4, 7, 10 (JSON)
- Then try exercises 5, 6, 8 (CSV)
- Finish with exercise 9 (multiple files)

**Sample Files to Create:**

For text exercises, create `sample.txt`:
```
Hello World
Python is awesome
File reading is fun
Practice makes perfect
```

For JSON, create `students.json`:
```json
[
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "grade": 75},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 21, "grade": 90}
]
```

For CSV, create `employees.csv`:
```
Name,Salary
Alice,75000
Bob,60000
Charlie,80000
```

Would you like me to provide solution hints for any specific exercise, or would you prefer to try them on your own first?
